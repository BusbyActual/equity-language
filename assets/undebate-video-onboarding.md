## Draft of our Project Video Script

Hi, my name is [NAME], and I'm a [ROLE] on equity language.

Equity language is working to create a tool that can scrape website text, flag instances of non-inclusive language, and provide education in order to create a more inclusive web. 

Our goal is to help make content on the web more inclusive towards all genders, LGBTQ+ people, and more. 

Think about equity language as making a Grammarly for inclusive language. 

Here are 3 examples:

We would flag...
* Fireman, and suggest "firefighter,"
* Stewardess and suggest "flight attendant"
* "Sexual preference," and suggest "sexual orientation" 

Following each suggestion, we'd have some education so that users would be able to make the right editing decisions.

We're a relatively fresh project, so new volunteers have a great opportunity to jump into the beginning of a project and see it through to the end. 

We are currently looking for:
* UX developer
* JavaScript programmer
* QA coder
* DevOps engineer 
* Gender/sexuality researcher
* Communications writer AND
* Videographer

Feel free poke around in our GitHub or slack our channel if you have any questions. 

Join the equity language project and help move the needle towards a more inclusive web.
