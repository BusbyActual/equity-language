# Gender equity

Gender equity is a priority for society and we want to improve gender inclusivity in our city and in our communications and our websites.

We are creating a web tool that searches websites for gender-exclusive words and suggests gender-inclusive words. For example, you can search for the gender-exclusive word "fireman", and the tool will find it, and suggest the gender-inclusive word "firefighter".



## How to contribute

We welcome help and constructive criticism. Here are some ways to parcipated.

* Join the team at Hack For LA. We meet on Tuesday evenings downtown, and we keep in touch during the week via remote tools like Slack and Zoom.

* Share your opinion about what words you want to search. We are currently experimenting with words on this [list](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/gender-inclusive-language), and we anticipate that many people may want to create their own lists of words.
